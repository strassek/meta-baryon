meta-baryon
===========

This layer provides support for building Baryon, a small Linux distribution
focused on NAS devices primarily supporting the Intel Black Sand (N450
development board).



Dependencies
------------

This layer depends on the Poky metadata. For more information on Poky see
the Yocto Project website:

http://www.yoctoproject.org.

Release edison-6.0 or later is required.



Maintenance
-----------

This layer is maintained by the Yocto Project. Send patches / pull requests
to yocto@yoctoproject.org with '[meta-baryon]' in the subject.



Building the meta-baryon layer
------------------------------

After you download meta-baryon, be sure to add its location to bblayers.conf.

The meta-baryon layer uses the 'lame' package, which has a license that
must be whitelisted by adding the string "commercial" to the
LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST variable in your local.conf. For example:

  LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial"

Optionally, you can set the DISTRO flag to both identify the image as Baryon 
and cut down DISTRO_FEATURES to something more appropriate for a headless NAS 
type device. For example:

  DISTRO = "baryon"

You should then be able to build the image as such:

  $ . ./oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake baryon-image
